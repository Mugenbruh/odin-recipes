    <p>
      This is my favorite method of making Italian sausage spaghetti. By
      browning the sausages first and then cooking them in the sauce at a long,
      slow simmer, the sausage is loaded with flavor and firm, but
      tender--almost meatball-like in texture. And we hardly need any seasonings
      because the long cook time allows the sauce to get infused with all the
      sausage-y goodness!
